# 3d-printed-paintings
Simple python programming implementing numpy stl to converty 2d images into 3d stl files for 3d printing.
# How to use
All libraries to import are included in the Collab file. Simply upload an image as "/home/mypaint.png" and click run. An stl file will be created under the content name "model.stl" containing the converted 3d image. To fine tune the process you can change the value of "conv" and "scaler" as well as turn on and off the inversion of the image.
NOTE: Because this program iterates over every pixel of an image it is not recommended to convert large pictures as they will cause the program to take a long time to complete and create very large stl files not suitable for printing.
